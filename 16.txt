🧾 5️⃣ Form Validation with Error Messages

Concepts: Controlled Components, Form Handling, Validation

Problem:
Build a Sign-Up Form in React that includes:

Username

Email

Password

Validate inputs before submission:

Username must be at least 3 characters.

Email must contain @.

Password must be at least 6 characters.

If any field fails validation, display an error message below that input.
On successful validation, display:
✅ “Form submitted successfully!”

Requirements:

Use useState to manage form data and errors.

Prevent form submission if any validation fails.

Reset form after success.

Hint:
Use a single state object like:

const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ username: '', email: '', password: '' });
