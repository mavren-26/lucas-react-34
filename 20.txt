🧩 Problem 1: Dynamic Counter with History

Problem:
Create a counter component that supports increment, decrement, and reset.
Additionally, keep a history of all counter values and display them below.

Concepts: useState, array manipulation, component rendering.

Input/Output Example:

Press Increment → history shows [1]

Press Increment again → [1, 2]

Press Decrement → [1, 2, 1]
