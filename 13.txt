🧭 2️⃣ Pagination Component

Concepts: Component props, useState, Array slicing

Problem:
Create a pagination system that displays 10 items per page from a list of 100 dummy items.
Add buttons Next and Previous to navigate through pages.

Requirements:

Keep track of current page using useState.

Disable “Previous” on the first page and “Next” on the last.

Pass current page and total items as props to a child component.

Hint:
Use array slicing: items.slice(startIndex, endIndex).
