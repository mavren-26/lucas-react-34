⚛️ 1️⃣ Searchable User List

Concepts: useEffect, useState, Fetch API, Filtering

Problem:
Build a React app that fetches user data from an API (like https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays it in a list.
Add a search box that filters users by name in real-time.

Requirements:

Fetch data using useEffect.

Filter users as the user types.

Show “No users found” if no matches.

Hint:
Use onChange for input and filter the state array using .filter().
