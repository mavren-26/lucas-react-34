🚀 Problem 2: Real-Time Search Filter for User List
Problem Statement

Build a React application that displays a list of users and allows the user to search in real time.

✔️ Requirements

Display a list of users (name + email)

Add an input box to search users

Filtering should happen instantly as user types

The search should filter based on:

Name

Email

Case-insensitive matching

Use React hooks (useState, useMemo)

✔️ Input

Search text entered by the user.

✔️ Output

Filtered user list based on the query.

✔️ Constraints

Use functional components

No API calls — use hardcoded static users
