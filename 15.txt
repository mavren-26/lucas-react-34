⏳ 4️⃣ Countdown Timer

Concepts: useEffect, useState, setInterval, Cleanup

Problem:
Build a countdown timer component that starts from 60 seconds and counts down to 0.
Include Start, Pause, and Reset buttons.

Requirements:

Use useState for time and running state.

Use useEffect with setInterval for countdown logic.

Clean up interval properly when paused or reset.

Hint:
Call clearInterval() inside cleanup function of useEffect.
